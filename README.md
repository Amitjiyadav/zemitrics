# Password Strength Regex Tester

## Goal
This project validates a list of passwords based on security rules like length, number, and special characters.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python
2. Run:
   python main.py

## Logic
I used Python regular expressions to check if a password contains at least one number, one special character, and has a minimum length of 8.

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was creating correct regex patterns for validation.

## Output
(Insert Screenshot Here)

## Future Improvements
I would add uppercase and lowercase validation and store results in a file.
